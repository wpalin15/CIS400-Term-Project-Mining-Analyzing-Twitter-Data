How to run the code:
1. There are accounts provided in sportsFans1.zip and sportsFans2.zip,
   but if you would like to fetch them yourself, run gather_accounts.py.
2. Then, locally sort the accounts by running filterAccountsLocation.py.
   (There is already sorted counts available in location_accounts.zip)
3. Once sorted, you can run USMostInfluential to generate the results for 
   the US, or worldMostInfluential to generate the results for the 49 countries.
